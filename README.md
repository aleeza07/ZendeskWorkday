Completed a hands-on Zendesk experience today! Registered a company website, worked on 9 tickets (5 auto-generated, 4 self-created), and tracked progress in an Excel sheet. A productive day exploring Zendesk's capabilities!

Zendesk Experience with Roco Private Limited

I successfully registered Roco Private Limited on Zendesk as my own company where I  gained hands-on experience in managing IT support queries. I worked on a range of sample tickets, addressing various customer concerns, including:
-Password Reset
- Product ethics and inquiries
- Zendesk functionality and usage
- Order-related queries (pack delivery, shipping cost, new delivery address)
- Product troubleshooting

This experience allowed me to explore Zendesk's capabilities and develop skills in providing effective customer support. I also created and resolved additional tickets, further enhancing my understanding of the platform.
